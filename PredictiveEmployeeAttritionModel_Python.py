# # **Capstone project: Providing data-driven suggestions for HR**

# ## Description and deliverables
# 
# This capstone project is about analyzing a dataset and build predictive models that can provide insights to the Human Resources (HR) department of a large consulting firm.
# 


# ## I have perticularly used the PACE method for this data analysis project. P: Plan; A: Analysing; C: Construct; E: Execute.
#


# ## **Pace 1: Plan**
# 

# ### Understanding the business scenario and problem
# 
# The HR department at Salifort Motors wants to take some initiatives to improve employee satisfaction levels at the company. They collected data from employees, but now they donâ€™t know what to do with it. They refer to a data analytics professional and ask to provide data-driven suggestions based on the understanding of the data. They have the following question: whatâ€™s likely to make the employee leave the company?
# 
# The goals in this project are to analyze the data collected by the HR department and to build a model that predicts whether or not an employee will leave the company. 
# 
# If can predict employees likely to quit, it might be possible to identify factors that contribute to their leaving. Because it is time-consuming and expensive to find, interview, and hire new employees, increasing employee retention will be beneficial to the company.
#
# In this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mfaisalqureshi/hr-analytics-and-job-prediction?select=HR_comma_sep.csv), there are 14,999 rows, 10 columns, and these variables: 
# 
# Variable  |Description |
# -----|-----| 
# satisfaction_level|Employee-reported job satisfaction level [0-1]|
# last_evaluation|Score of employee's last performance review [0-1]|
# number_project|Number of projects employee contributes to|
# average_monthly_hours|Average number of hours employee worked per month|
# time_spend_company|How long the employee has been with the company (years)
# Work_accident|Whether or not the employee experienced an accident while at work
# left|Whether or not the employee left the company
# promotion_last_5years|Whether or not the employee was promoted in the last 5 years
# Department|The employee's department
# salary|The employee's salary (U.S. dollars)

# ### Load dataset
# In[2]:
# Load dataset into a dataframe
df0 = pd.read_csv("HR_capstone_dataset.csv")

# Display first few rows of the dataframe
df0.head()

# ## Step 2. Data Exploration (Initial EDA and data cleaning)
# 
# - Understanding the variables
# - Clean the dataset (missing data, redundant data, outliers) 
# 
# 



# ### Gather basic information about the data
# In[3]:
df0.info()



# In[4]:
# Gather descriptive statistics about the data
df0.describe()



# ### Rename columns
# As a data cleaning step, renaming the columns as needed is a must. Standardizing the column names so that they are all in `snake_case`, correcting any column names that are misspelled, and making column names more concise as needed.




# In[5]:
# Display all column names
df0.columns




# In[6]:
# Rename columns as needed
df0 = df0.rename(columns={'Work_accident': 'work_accident',
                          'average_montly_hours': 'average_monthly_hours',
                          'time_spend_company': 'tenure',
                          'Department': 'department'})

# Display all column names after the update
df0.columns




# ### Check missing values
# In[7]:
# Check for missing values
df0.isna().sum()

# There are no missing values in the data.




# ### Check duplicates
# Check for any duplicate entries in the data.
# In[8]:
# Check for duplicates
df0.duplicated().sum()

# 3,008 rows contain duplicates. That is 20% of the data.

# Drop duplicates and save resulting dataframe in a new variable as needed
df1 = df0.drop_duplicates(keep='first')

# Display first few rows of new dataframe as needed
df1.head()



# ### Check outliers
# Check for outliers in the data.
# In[11]:
# Create a boxplot to visualize distribution of `tenure` and detect any outliers
plt.figure(figsize=(6,6))
plt.title('Boxplot to detect outliers for tenure', fontsize=12)
plt.xticks(fontsize=12)
plt.yticks(fontsize=12)
sns.boxplot(x=df1['tenure'])
plt.show()

# The boxplot above shows that there are outliers in the `tenure` variable. 




# It would be helpful to investigate how many rows in the data contain outliers in the `tenure` column.
# In[12]:
# Determine the number of rows containing outliers 

# Compute the 25th percentile value in `tenure`
percentile25 = df1['tenure'].quantile(0.25)

# Compute the 75th percentile value in `tenure`
percentile75 = df1['tenure'].quantile(0.75)

# Compute the interquartile range in `tenure`
iqr = percentile75 - percentile25

# Define the upper limit and lower limit for non-outlier values in `tenure`
upper_limit = percentile75 + 1.5 * iqr
lower_limit = percentile25 - 1.5 * iqr
print("Lower limit:", lower_limit)
print("Upper limit:", upper_limit)

# Identify subset of data containing outliers in `tenure`
outliers = df1[(df1['tenure'] > upper_limit) | (df1['tenure'] < lower_limit)]

# Count how many rows in the data contain outliers in `tenure`
print("Number of rows in the data containing outliers in `tenure`:", len(outliers))









# # pAce 2: Analyze Stage
# - Perform EDA (analyze relationships between variables) 
# 
# 

# ## Step 1. Data Exploration (Continue EDA)
# 
# Begin by understanding how many employees left and what percentage of all employees this figure represents.

# In[13]:
# Get numbers of people who left vs. stayed
print(df1['left'].value_counts())
print()

# Get percentages of people who left vs. stayed
print(df1['left'].value_counts(normalize=True))



# ### Data visualizations
# In[14]:

# Create a plot as needed 
# Set figure and axes
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize = (22,8))

# Create boxplot showing `average_monthly_hours` distributions for `number_project`, comparing employees who stayed versus those who left
sns.boxplot(data=df1, x='average_monthly_hours', y='number_project', hue='left', orient="h", ax=ax[0])
ax[0].invert_yaxis()
ax[0].set_title('Monthly hours by number of projects', fontsize='14')

# Create histogram showing distribution of `number_project`, comparing employees who stayed versus those who left
tenure_stay = df1[df1['left']==0]['number_project']
tenure_left = df1[df1['left']==1]['number_project']
sns.histplot(data=df1, x='number_project', hue='left', multiple='dodge', shrink=2, ax=ax[1])
ax[1].set_title('Number of projects histogram', fontsize='14')

# Display the plots
plt.show()


# It might be natural that people who work on more projects would also work longer hours. This appears to be the case here, with the mean hours of each group (stayed and left) increasing with number of projects worked. However, a few things stand out from this plot.
# 
# 1. There are two groups of employees who left the company: (A) those who worked considerably less than their peers with the same number of projects, and (B) those who worked much more. Of those in group A, it's possible that they were fired. It's also possible that this group includes employees who had already given their notice and were assigned fewer hours because they were already on their way out the door. For those in group B, it's reasonable to infer that they probably quit. The folks in group B likely contributed a lot to the projects they worked in; they might have been the largest contributors to their projects. 
# 
# 2. Everyone with seven projects left the company, and the interquartile ranges of this group and those who left with six projects was ~255-295 hours/month-much more than any other group. 
# 
# 3. The optimal number of projects for employees to work on seems to be 3-4. The ratio of left/stayed is very small for these cohorts.
# 
# 4. If assume a work week of 40 hours and two weeks of vacation per year, then the average number of working hours per month of employees working Monday-Friday `= 50 weeks * 40 hours per week / 12 months = 166.67 hours per month`. This means that, aside from the employees who worked on two projects, every group-even those who didn't leave the company-worked considerably more hours than this. It seems that employees here are overworked.
# 



# In[15]:
# Get value counts of stayed/left for employees with 7 projects
df1[df1['number_project']==7]['left'].value_counts()


# This confirms that all employees with 7 projects did leave. 
# 
# Examine the average monthly hours versus the satisfaction levels. 



# In[16]:

# Create scatterplot of `average_monthly_hours` versus `satisfaction_level`, comparing employees who stayed versus those who left
plt.figure(figsize=(16, 9))
sns.scatterplot(data=df1, x='average_monthly_hours', y='satisfaction_level', hue='left', alpha=0.4)
plt.axvline(x=166.67, color='#ff6361', label='166.67 hrs./mo.', ls='--')
plt.legend(labels=['166.67 hrs./mo.', 'left', 'stayed'])
plt.title('Monthly hours by last evaluation score', fontsize='14');


# The scatterplot above shows that there was a sizeable group of employees who worked ~240-315 hours per month. 315 hours per month is over 75 hours per week for a whole year. It's likely this is related to their satisfaction levels being close to zero. 
# 
# The plot also shows another group of people who left, those who had more normal working hours. Even so, their satisfaction was only around 0.4. It's difficult to speculate about why they might have left. It's possible they felt pressured to work more, considering so many of their peers worked more. And that pressure could have lowered their satisfaction levels. 
# 
# Finally, there is a group who worked ~210-280 hours per month, and they had satisfaction levels ranging ~0.70-9. 
# 
# Note the strange shape of the distributions here. This is indicative of data manipulation or synthetic data. 




# For the next visualization, it might be interesting to visualize satisfaction levels by tenure.
# In[17]:

# Create a plot as needed 
# Set figure and axes
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize = (22,8))

# Create boxplot showing distributions of `satisfaction_level` by tenure, comparing employees who stayed versus those who left
sns.boxplot(data=df1, x='satisfaction_level', y='tenure', hue='left', orient="h", ax=ax[0])
ax[0].invert_yaxis()
ax[0].set_title('Satisfaction by tenure', fontsize='14')

# Create histogram showing distribution of `tenure`, comparing employees who stayed versus those who left
tenure_stay = df1[df1['left']==0]['tenure']
tenure_left = df1[df1['left']==1]['tenure']
sns.histplot(data=df1, x='tenure', hue='left', multiple='dodge', shrink=5, ax=ax[1])
ax[1].set_title('Tenure histogram', fontsize='14')

plt.show();


# There are many observations that could make from this plot.
# - Employees who left fall into two general categories: dissatisfied employees with shorter tenures and very satisfied employees with medium-length tenures.
# - Four-year employees who left seem to have an unusually low satisfaction level. It's worth investigating changes to company policy that might have affected people specifically at the four-year mark, if possible. 
# - The longest-tenured employees didn't leave. Their satisfaction levels aligned with those of newer employees who stayed. 
# - The histogram shows that there are relatively few longer-tenured employees. It's possible that they're the higher-ranking, higher-paid employees.
# 



# In[18]:

# Calculate mean and median satisfaction scores of employees who left and those who stayed
df1.groupby(['left'])['satisfaction_level'].agg([np.mean,np.median])

# As expected, the mean and median satisfaction scores of employees who left are lower than those of employees who stayed. Interestingly, among employees who stayed, the mean satisfaction score appears to be slightly below the median score. This indicates that satisfaction levels among those who stayed might be skewed to the left.

# Define long-tenured employees
tenure_long = df1[df1['tenure'] > 6]

# Plot short-tenured histogram
sns.histplot(data=tenure_short, x='tenure', hue='salary', discrete=1,

             hue_order=['low', 'medium', 'high'], multiple='dodge', shrink=.4, ax=ax[1])
ax[1].set_title('Salary histogram by tenure: long-tenured people', fontsize='14');


# The plots above show that long-tenured employees were not disproportionately comprised of higher-paid employees. 
#



# In[20]:

# Create scatterplot of `average_monthly_hours` versus `last_evaluation`
plt.figure(figsize=(16, 9))

plt.legend(labels=['166.67 hrs./mo.', 'left', 'stayed'])
plt.title('Monthly hours by last evaluation score', fontsize='14');


# The following observations can be made from the scatterplot above:
# - The scatterplot indicates two groups of employees who left: overworked employees who performed very well and employees who worked slightly under the nominal monthly average of 166.67 hours with lower evaluation scores. 
# - There seems to be a correlation between hours worked and evaluation score. 
# - There isn't a high percentage of employees in the upper left quadrant of this plot; but working long hours doesn't guarantee a good evaluation score.
# - Most of the employees in this company work well over 167 hours per month.

heatmap.set_title('Correlation Heatmap', fontdict={'fontsize':14}, pad=12);


# The correlation heatmap confirms that the number of projects, monthly hours, and evaluation scores all have some positive correlation with each other, and whether an employee leaves is negatively correlated with their satisfaction level.



# ### Insights

# It appears that employees are leaving the company as a result of poor management. Leaving is tied to longer working hours, many projects, and generally lower satisfaction levels. It can be ungratifying to work long hours and not receive promotions or good evaluation scores. There's a sizeable group of employees at this company who are probably burned out. It also appears that if an employee has spent more than six years at the company, they tend not to leave. 





# # paCe 3: Construct Stage
# - Determine which models are most appropriate
# - Construct the model 
# - Confirm model assumptions
# - Evaluate model results to determine how well your model fits the data
# 

# ## Recall model assumptions
# 
# **Logistic Regression model assumptions**
# - Outcome variable is categorical
# - Observations are independent of each other
# - No severe multicollinearity among X variables 
# - No extreme outliers
# - Linear relationship between each X variable and the logit of the outcome variable
# - Sufficiently large sample size 
# 
# 
# 
# 

# ## Step 3. Model Building, Step 4. Results and Evaluation
# - Fit a model that predicts the outcome variable using two or more independent variables
# - Check model assumptions
# - Evaluate the model


# The goal is to predict whether an employee leaves the company, which is a categorical outcome variable. So this task involves classification. More specifically, this involves binary classification, since the outcome variable `left` can be either 1 (indicating employee left) or 0 (indicating employee didn't leave). 

# ### Identify the types of models most appropriate for this task.

# Since the variable you want to predict (whether an employee leaves the company) is categorical, you could either build a Logistic Regression model, or a Tree-based Machine Learning model.
# 
# So you could proceed with one of the two following approaches. Or, if you'd like, you could implement both and determine how they compare.

# ### Modeling Approach A: Logistic Regression Model
# 
# This approach covers implementation of Logistic Regression.

# #### Logistic regression
# Note that binomial logistic regression suits the task because it involves binary classification.

# Before splitting the data, encode the non-numeric variables. There are two: `department` and `salary`. 
# 
# `department` is a categorical variable, which means it can dummy for modeling. 
# 
# `salary` is categorical too, but it's ordinal. There's a hierarchy to the categories, so it's better not to dummy this column, but rather to convert the levels to numbers, 0-2.




# In[25]:

# Copy the dataframe
df_enc = df1.copy()

# Encode the `salary` column as an ordinal numeric category
df_enc['salary'] = (
    df_enc['salary'].astype('category')
    .cat.set_categories(['low', 'medium', 'high'])
    .cat.codes
)

# Dummy encode the `department` column
df_enc = pd.get_dummies(df_enc, drop_first=False)

# Display the new dataframe
df_enc.head()


# Create a heatmap to visualize how correlated variables are. Consider which variables you're interested in examining correlations between.
# In[26]:


# Create a heatmap to visualize how correlated variables are
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.heatmap(df_enc[['satisfaction_level', 'last_evaluation', 'number_project', 'average_monthly_hours', 'tenure']]
            .corr(), annot=True, cmap="crest")
plt.title('Heatmap of the dataset')
plt.show()


# Create a stacked bart plot to visualize number of employees across department, comparing those who left with those who didn't.
# In[27]:

# Create a stacked bart plot to visualize number of employees across department, comparing those who left with those who didn't
# In the legend, 0 (purple color) represents employees who did not leave, 1 (red color) represents employees who left
pd.crosstab(df1['department'], df1['left']).plot(kind ='bar',color='mr')
plt.title('Counts of employees who left versus stayed across department')
plt.ylabel('Employee count')
plt.xlabel('Department')
plt.show()

# Since logistic regression is quite sensitive to outliers, it would be a good idea at this stage to remove the outliers in the `tenure` column that were identified earlier.



# In[28]:

# Select rows without outliers in `tenure` and save resulting dataframe in a new variable
df_logreg = df_enc[(df_enc['tenure'] >= lower_limit) & (df_enc['tenure'] <= upper_limit)]

# Display first few rows of new dataframe
df_logreg.head()



# Isolate the outcome variable, which is the variable you want your model to predict.
# In[29]:

# Isolate the outcome variable
y = df_logreg['left']

# Display first few rows of the outcome variable
y.head() 



# Select the features that is wanted to use in your model. Consider which variables will help to predict the outcome variable, `left`.
# In[30]:

# Select the features you want to use in your model
X = df_logreg.drop('left', axis=1)

# Display the first few rows of the selected features 
X.head()



# Split the data into training set and testing set. Don't forget to stratify based on the values in `y`, since the classes are unbalanced.
# In[31]:

# Split the data into training set and testing set
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.25, stratify=y, random_state=42)



# In[32]:

# Construct a logistic regression model and fit it to the training dataset
log_clf = LogisticRegression(random_state=42, max_iter=500).fit(X_train, y_train)

# Test the logistic regression model: use the model to make predictions on the test set.



# In[33]:

# Use the logistic regression model to get predictions on the test set
y_pred = log_clf.predict(X_test)



# Create a confusion matrix to visualize the results of the logistic regression model. 
# In[34]:

# Compute values for confusion matrix
log_cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred, labels=log_clf.classes_)

# Create display of confusion matrix
log_disp = ConfusionMatrixDisplay(confusion_matrix=log_cm, 
                                  display_labels=log_clf.classes_)

# Plot confusion matrix
log_disp.plot(values_format='')

# Display plot
plt.show()


# The upper-left quadrant displays the number of true negatives.
# The upper-right quadrant displays the number of false positives.
# The bottom-left quadrant displays the number of false negatives.
# The bottom-right quadrant displays the number of true positives.
# 
# True negatives: The number of people who did not leave that the model accurately predicted did not leave.
# 
# False positives: The number of people who did not leave the model inaccurately predicted as leaving.
# 
# False negatives: The number of people who left that the model inaccurately predicted did not leave
# 
# True positives: The number of people who left the model accurately predicted as leaving
# 
# A perfect model would yield all true negatives and true positives, and no false negatives or false positives.

# Create a classification report that includes precision, recall, f1-score, and accuracy metrics to evaluate the performance of the logistic regression model.



# Check the class balance in the data. In other words, check the value counts in the `left` column. Since this is a binary classification task, the class balance informs the way you interpret accuracy metrics.
# In[35]:

df_logreg['left'].value_counts(normalize=True)

# There is an approximately 83%-17% split. So the data is not perfectly balanced, but it is not too imbalanced. If it was more severely imbalanced, shouldn't want to resample the data to make it more balanced. In this case, can use this data without modifying the class balance and continue evaluating the model.



# In[36]:

# Create classification report for logistic regression model
target_names = ['Predicted would not leave', 'Predicted would leave']
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred, target_names=target_names))

# The classification report above shows that the logistic regression model achieved a precision of 79%, recall of 82%, f1-score of 80% (all weighted averages), and accuracy of 82%. However, if it's most important to predict employees who leave, then the scores are significantly lower.

# ### Modeling Approach B: Tree-based Model
# This approach covers implementation of Decision Tree and Random Forest. 




# Isolate the outcome variable.
# In[37]:

# Isolate the outcome variable
y = df_enc['left']

# Display the first few rows of `y`
y.head()




# Select the features. 
# In[38]:

# Select the features
X = df_enc.drop('left', axis=1)

# Display the first few rows of `X`
X.head()



# Split the data into training, validating, and testing sets.
# In[39]:

# Split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.25, stratify=y, random_state=0)





# #### Decision tree - Round 1

# Construct a decision tree model and set up cross-validated grid-search to exhuastively search for the best model parameters.

# In[40]:

# Instantiate model
tree = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=0)

# Assign a dictionary of hyperparameters to search over
cv_params = {'max_depth':[4, 6, 8, None],
             'min_samples_leaf': [2, 5, 1],
             'min_samples_split': [2, 4, 6]
             }

# Assign a dictionary of scoring metrics to capture
scoring = {'accuracy', 'precision', 'recall', 'f1', 'roc_auc'}

# Instantiate GridSearch
tree1 = GridSearchCV(tree, cv_params, scoring=scoring, cv=4, refit='roc_auc')



# Fit the decision tree model to the training data.
# In[41]:

get_ipython().run_cell_magic('time', '', 'tree1.fit(X_train, y_train)')



# Identify the optimal values for the decision tree parameters.
# In[42]:

# Check best parameters
tree1.best_params_



# Identify the best AUC score achieved by the decision tree model on the training set.
# In[43]:

# Check best AUC score on CV
tree1.best_score_

# This is a strong AUC score, which shows that this model can predict employees who will leave very well.
# 



# Next, writing a function that will help to extract all the scores from the grid search.
